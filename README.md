"SpaceShooterGame" is the project in java.

in the "game_app" you will find "game.exe" which is the game application directly instead of running the code (just make sure u have a jre minimum 1.8.0).

in "video" you will find a screen recorded video of me playing the game.

game rules :

- move the spaceship using the arrow keys.

- shoot down the aliens by pressing the space bar

- your energy decreases each time you hit an alien or an asteroid

- if your energy gets to zero you will lose the game

- if you shoot down all the aliens you win the game
